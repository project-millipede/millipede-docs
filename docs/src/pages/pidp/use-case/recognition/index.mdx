> The user's actual consumption behavior within social media applications only
> perceives content in the primary field of vision of a content post. Relevant
> content that implements the contradiction to critical postings, however, is
> hidden in the comment system of a social media application - see the visual
> description of the problem in Figure 5 - Relevant content that executes the
> contradiction gets buried in the comment system of social media applications.
